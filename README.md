# Quote-Generator

I took a little time away from JS to spend learning and understanding wordpress.  
I am currently building out different projects to get back into the swing of JS to start applying for front-end developer positions.

This is a simple quote generator, with the option to get a new quote and post the current quote to twitter.
This project uses the type.fit api for quotes, google fonts, font-awesome, and an svg background from heropatterns.com
